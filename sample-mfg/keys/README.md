# Sample Manufacturer Keys

The simulate-mfg.sh script needs a private key for the "manufacturer". We provide a sample key to use for dev/test/demo, that comes from `supply-chain-tools-v1.9.0/docker_manufacturer/keys/manufacturer-keystore.p12` .

Note: The file `keys/manufacturer-keystore.p12` and `keys/owner-key.pub` will be automatically created in this directory as temporary files the keys are placed in during runtime, so they are listed in `.gitignore`.
