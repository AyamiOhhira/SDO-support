# Sample Manufacturer Keys

The simulate-mfg.sh script needs a private key for the "manufacturer". We provide a sample key to use for dev/test/demo, that was originally taken from `Services.tar` file `SCT/keys/sdo.p12` .

The files `keys/sdo.p12` and `keys/owner-key.pub` are temporary files the keys are placed in during runtime, so they are in `.gitignore`.
